# Iteration 5 Week 2 - Julian & Finn

## Code-Behavior

We removed the label from the Code-Behavior and use its name from the SceneTree instead. We found ourself labeling nodes twice (once in the tree and then again in the label) so we decided to change this.

Also we added comments to the Behavior.
